# SubGenCluster
This is the API server for SubGenCluster, a crowdsourced distributed cluster for generating machine transcriptions and translations.  
This repo hosts the backend code and API docs. It is, at the moment, ***very*** under construction.  
While you're here, feel free to check out the (also very WIP) [API documentation](https://subgencluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
